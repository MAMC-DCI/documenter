# Overview
It is sometimes necessary to document all the files in a directory. Using the function *document_it*, all files can quickly and thoroughly be aggregated automatically into a double spaced document. By creating an annotation file, additional comments can be added for each file without additional intervention.


# Usage
The package can be loaded via the *library* function.
```r
# Load the package.
library(documenter)
```


The function *document_it* accepts 3 arguments:


- *input_directory*: The directory of files to be documented.
- *output_file*: The path to the output file that will be generated.
- *annotation_file*: The path to the annotation file if present.


An example use case is provided below. This documents all files in the "man" folder within the current working directory. Note that this is a recursive operation. Thus, all files contained within subdirectories of the "man" folder will also be documented.
```{r eval=FALSE}
document_it(
  input_directory = "man",
  output_file = "documentation",
  annotation_file = NULL
)
```
