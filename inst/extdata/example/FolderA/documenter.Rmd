# Overview
It is sometimes necessary to document all the files in a directory. Using the function *document_it*, all files can quickly and thoroughly be documented automatically. By creating an annotation file, additional comments can be added for each file without additional intervention.


# Usage
The package can be loaded via the *library* function.
```r
# Load the package.
library(documenter)
```


The function *document_it* accepts 3 arguments:


- *input_directory*: The directory of files to be documented.
- *output_file*: The path to the output file that will be generated.
- *annotation_file*: The path to the annotation file if present.


An example use case is provided below.
```r
document_it(
  input_directory = "man",
  output_file = "documentation",
  annotation_file = NULL
)
```
